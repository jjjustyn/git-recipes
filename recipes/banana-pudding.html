            <h2>MEAT SAUCE & CREAM RECIPE</h2>
            <em>This recipe is formulated for an 8 inch (20 cm) square pan and would serve 4-6 people â€” </em>
            <strong>NOTE</strong>
            <em>this is half the size of the lasagna I baked in the video. 
                I'm giving the meat sauce recipe from the video below, 
                but you could make it with about two pounds (a kilo) of frozen meat sauce from my old recipe <a href = "https://youtu.be/V5WR-K0zJYs ">here</a>:
            </em>
            
            <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
                <li>6 cups 2% milk</li>
                <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter, cubed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>TOPPING:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 packages (11 ounces each) vanilla wafers</li>
                <li>7 medium bananas, sliced</li>
                <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large heavy saucepan, mix sugar and cornstarch. Whisk in milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk a small amount of hot mixture into egg yolks; return all to pan, whisking constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in butter, vanilla and salt. Cool 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reserve 1 banana and 1 cup whole wafers for topping. Crush 2 cups wafers and set aside. In a 13x9-in. baking dish, place a single layer of whole wafers, filling gaps with crushed wafers. Layer with a third of the bananas and pudding. Repeat layers twice. Press waxed paper onto surface of pudding. Refrigerate, covered, overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a bowl, beat heavy cream until it begins to thicken. Add sugar; beat until soft peaks form (do not overmix). Just before serving, remove papaer and spread whipped cream over pudding; top with reserved banana and wafers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving with fresh herbs. If you want a tidier presentation, chill the lasagna whole in the fridge. When it's firm, you'll get cleaner edges when you cut. Reheat the cut pieces on top of a little splash of water in a covered baking dish in the oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and broil on a little more mozzarella, to make the top look nicer.
