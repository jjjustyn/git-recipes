        <h2>Banana Pudding</h2>
        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <h4>VANILLA PUDDING</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>6 cups 2% milk</li>
            <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>TOPPING:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages (11 ounces each) vanilla wafers</li>
            <li>7 medium bananas, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large heavy saucepan, mix sugar and cornstarch. Whisk in milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until
                thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk a small amount of hot mixture into egg yolks; return all to pan, whisking constantly.
                Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in butter, vanilla and salt.
                Cool 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reserve 1 banana and 1 cup whole wafers for topping. Crush 2 cups wafers and set aside. In a 13x9-in.
                baking dish, place a single layer of whole wafers, filling gaps with crushed wafers. Layer with a third
                of the bananas and pudding. Repeat layers twice. Press waxed paper onto surface of pudding. Refrigerate,
                covered, overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, beat heavy cream until it begins to thicken. Add sugar; beat until soft peaks form (do not
                overmix). Just before serving, remove papaer and spread whipped cream over pudding; top with reserved
                banana and wafers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving with fresh herbs. If you want a tidier
                presentation, chill the lasagna whole in the fridge. When it's firm, you'll get cleaner edges when you
                cut. Reheat the cut pieces on top of a little splash of water in a covered baking dish in the oven for
                15 minutes. Uncover and broil on a little more mozzarella, to make the top look nicer.
